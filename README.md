# vlens

vlens turns one hidden activation of a language model into a picture, with no text anywhere in the image path. The same
model then looks at the picture, and its new activation is compared directly with the original one.

The source and reader is Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct, a vision-language model. The image generator is FLUX.2 [klein] 4B, a
4-step distilled rectified-flow model that normally reads the hidden states of a Qwen3 text encoder. In vlens klein
gets no prompt and no word embeddings. A small trained adapter computes klein's entire conditioning from the activation.

## Pipeline

1. **Activation.** Qwen3-VL's residual stream after decoder layers 9, 18 and 27 (pre-norm), taken at the last
   position of the reply start and concatenated: 3 x 2560 = 7,680 numbers.
2. **Adapter.** A MetaQuery-style connector maps that vector to 64 conditioning tokens of size 7,680:
   - the standardized activation becomes 8 tokens;
   - 64 learned queries attend to them through a 4-layer transformer;
   - a zero-initialized projection writes the result on top of klein's blank conditioning (the encoding of an empty
     prompt, one constant);
   - a zero-initialized per-channel gate also passes the raw activation through.
3. **Picture.** Klein (frozen) runs its own 4-step Euler sampler at 384 px from that conditioning.
4. **Readback.** Qwen3-VL reads the picture in the same context the source activation came from, with the picture in
   place of the content:
   - a caption chat "Picture this scene in your mind: {caption} ..." becomes "... in your mind: [picture] ...";
   - a character chat "You are {x}. ..." becomes "You are [picture]. ...".

   The new activation is compared with the source activation directly, after standardizing each dimension by its
   training mean and spread (fixed constants). No probe or readout is fitted.

## Sources of activations

| source | what Qwen3-VL gets | ground truth |
|---|---|---|
| `see` | a real photo (COCO or CC3M) and "keep it in mind, just reply OK"; no caption anywhere | the photo |
| `inj` | a text-only chat with no image and no description. The see context's states at the 5 reply-start positions after layer 8 are copied in, bypassing tokens, and the model computes on from there | the photo |
| `hold` | the photo's caption in a text-only chat, under 7 training wordings and 2 test wordings | the photo |
| `char` | "You are <character>" chats (264 characters, 53 held out) | none |

## Training

- **Stage B (oracle style, supervised).** Klein's own flow-matching loss, with the real photo as the target:
  1. encode the photo with klein's VAE (latent x0);
  2. mix in noise at one of klein's 4 sampling levels, x_t = (1 - s) x0 + s * noise;
  3. klein predicts the velocity (noise - x0) from x_t, s and the adapter's conditioning;
  4. the loss is the mean squared error. Only the adapter is trained.

  Klein can only denoise well if the conditioning says what the photo is, so the adapter must carry the photo's
  content from the activation.
- **Stage C (NLA style, unsupervised reconstruction added).** The adapter makes a picture through klein's 4 sampling
  steps and the VAE decoder, and Qwen3-VL reads it back in the source's own context; gradients flow through all of
  these.
  - The loss is the mean squared error between the standardized readback and source activations: the picture must
    let the model rebuild its own activation.
  - This loss needs no photo or label, so character activations train on it alone.
  - The stage B loss stays on, to keep pictures natural and to limit hiding information in pixel patterns that only
    the reader decodes.

## Evaluation

- **Test sets.** 1,000 held-out photos (500 COCO, 500 CC3M) under 4 sources, plus 53 held-out characters.
- **Reconstruction.** Fraction of variance explained between the readback and the source activation (standardized).
  Two references: the real photo read back in the same context (how much any picture could explain), and shuffled
  pairs (no item information).
- **Readback rank.** The source's rank among all 1,000 sources.
- **SigLIP 2 rank.** The real photo's rank among the 1,000 real photos by SigLIP 2 (so400m/16-512) image-image
  similarity. No stage trains on this scorer.
- **Text route.** Klein given the caption as an ordinary prompt: the text-bottleneck reference.
- **Prior control.** Random activations with the same per-dimension mean and spread as real ones. If these also
  produce confident, meaningful scenes, the pictures reflect klein's prior rather than Qwen's state.

## Run

```
pip install -e .
scripts/test_tiny.sh                      # every stage in minutes, small random Qwen3-VL (plumbing only)
scripts/run_all.sh /data/work /data/run   # full run on one 80 GB GPU, about 4 hours on an A100
```

All models and data are public: Qwen/Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct, black-forest-labs/FLUX.2-klein-4B (Apache 2.0),
